# Fire Detection Project

## Overview

The Fire Detection Project enables automatic detection of fire through CCTV cameras without human intervention. Using a pre-trained `.onnx` model, this project aims to enhance video surveillance systems by providing real-time fire detection capabilities.

## Installation

To set up the Fire Detection Project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Go**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. **Install GoCV**: GoCV is a Go package for computer vision using OpenCV. Install it by following the instructions on the [GoCV installation guide](https://gocv.io/getting-started/).

3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. This project primarily relies on Go and GoCV.

## Usage

To use the Fire Detection Project:

1. **Set Up**: Ensure that your CCTV camera is properly configured and connected.

2. **Run the Application**: Start the application using the provided scripts or commands. The application will process the video feed from the CCTV camera and detect fire in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time fire detection
- Automatic monitoring through CCTV cameras
- Based on a pre-trained `.onnx` model
